# React Youtube
Developed a basic React application using Youtube API. 

Currently displays only 5 videos of a particular title. 
Selected videos of 'Gary Vaynerchuk' as a default video title to display videos
Focused more on getting familiar with React rather than UI.
SearchBar autoupdates the videos result without any press of a button.
Planning to add Firebase authentication service in the later time


This application is hosted on Firebase and the link can be found in the description above.
